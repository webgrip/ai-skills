# Flow metrics and the SLE

What to measure, what it means, and what it is for. The arithmetic lives in
[scripts/flow_metrics.py](scripts/flow_metrics.py) (offline, stdlib-only) — feed it raw
ClickUp MCP payloads (`--tasks`) or normalized items from any other tracker
(`--items`). **Every metric must name the action it triggers** — a metric that feeds no
decision is theater.

## The definitions (Kanban Guide, v2025.5)

Four mandatory flow metrics, quoted:

| Metric | Definition | The action it feeds |
|---|---|---|
| **WIP** | "The number of work items started but not finished" | Refuse pulls over the cap; over-limit explains a bad cycle time by itself |
| **Throughput** | "The number of work items finished per unit of time" | Forecasting (Monte Carlo over item counts); trend vs WIP |
| **Work Item Age** | "The elapsed time between when a work item started and the current date" | **The one leading indicator**: age at/past the SLE ⇒ intervene today — split, swarm, unblock, or drop |
| **Cycle Time** | "The elapsed time between when a work item started and when a work item finished" | Recalibrating the SLE; right-sizing |

An **SLE** is a forecast with two parts: **an elapsed-time period and a probability**.
"85% within 8 days" is an SLE; "8 days" is a wish. Derive it from the board's own
completed history (default: 85th percentile), state it with its sample size ("85%
within N days, from M finished items since <date>"), recompute every ~10 finished
items, and **never** turn it into a target to hold anyone to.

**Right-sizing replaces estimating**: once there's history, the refinement question is
"does this fit inside the SLE?" — if not, split. No story points: item counts forecast
as well as point sums, and pointed velocity collapses under Goodhart pressure the
moment anyone reads it in a review.

## Where start and finish live

"Started" and "finished" are the *contract's* Definition of Workflow (typical: started =
entering doing; finished = the agreement's real done status). Creation time is when
someone *wrote* the ticket — months before anyone started, on real boards. Without a
measured start the script falls back to created→finished and labels it a **lead-time
proxy**; a missing start is "no measured start", never zero. Trackers also lie:
done-*typed* statuses that the agreement treats as intermediate (merged/testing/
carryover) never count as finished — say so when your number disagrees with the tool's
own widgets.

## Running it

ClickUp: save the raw MCP output to files and feed it straight in (sources and the
"Total time in Status" ClickApp requirement: [adapters/clickup.md](adapters/clickup.md)):

```bash
python3 scripts/flow_metrics.py --tasks open.json done.json \
    --status-history history.json --wip-limit 3 --percentile 85
```

Any other tracker: normalize to the item shape in the script's docstring (recipe in
your adapter's timestamps section) and run `--items board.json`.

The contract's knobs: `--started-states` (default doing + review states — the Kanban
Guide's started-but-not-finished; a cap that governs doing alone passes
`--started-states doing` and checks the review column against its own cap separately) ·
`--done-state` (the agreement's real finished status) · `--not-done` (done-typed
intermediates) · `--area-tags` (enables the exactly-one-area-tag check) · `--pullable`
(statuses at/past which priority is expected).

It reports WIP vs cap, Work Item Age oldest-first, weekly Throughput, the Cycle Time
distribution, the SLE — plus the board-invariant violations it can see (product-name
titles, tag drift, P0 inflation, no-measured-start). `--json` for machine-readable. It
**refuses to state an SLE under ~10 finished items**, because a percentile over five
tickets is theater.

## Reading the result

- **Age above the SLE is the number that produces action today.** Age needs no history
  at all — start with it.
- **WIP over the limit explains a bad cycle time by itself.** Fix WIP before theorizing.
- **Throughput trending down while WIP trends up** is the signature of starting instead
  of finishing.
- **Pair every speed number with a stability guardrail** — rework rate, bounce-backs
  from test/review (e.g. a board's Rejected-counters), reopens. AI-era telemetry shows
  throughput and instability rising *together*; rising throughput with rising rework is
  net-negative, and merged-without-review is a red flag, not velocity.
- **When agents execute, watch the review queue**: time-to-first-review and
  oldest-awaiting-review are the age metrics that matter most (measured: agent PRs wait
  ~5× longer for pickup). The review column gets its own WIP cap and its own SLE.
- **Forecast with ranges, never dates**: "when will it be done" gets a probabilistic
  answer at named confidence levels from recent throughput — and the sample is void
  after a regime change (team change, agent adoption); re-baseline instead of trusting
  stale history.
- **Track agent-ticket classes separately**: acceptance rate and bounce-backs per class
  decide where delegation expands ([agents.md](agents.md)).

## Honest caveats

- These are properties of the **workflow, never of a person** — no per-assignee
  rankings, human or agent; decline the request and offer a system-level view instead.
- Multiple started-intervals (ticket bounced back and forth): measured time in started
  states is closer to truth than first-touch-to-close, but differs from
  calendar-elapsed — report both when they'd differ materially.
- Don't build gates on **flow efficiency** percentages (wait-vs-active classification is
  arbitrary and timestamps too coarse) — use blocked-item count, blocked elapsed time,
  and queue age instead.
- A forecast is conditional on WIP control: without it there is no predictability and
  the Monte Carlo is decoration.
