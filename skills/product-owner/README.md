# product-owner

Run any ticket board as product owner — one discipline, per-tool adapters. Ticket
intake, refinement to a research-backed Definition of Ready, binary acceptance criteria
with verification, an **agent-ready gate** for work AI coding agents execute,
prioritization and pick-up ordering, WIP limits anchored on review capacity, dependency
sequencing, splitting, backlog sweeps, a **Definition of Mergeable** gating every PR/MR
before it lands, evidence-based closing on a Definition of Done, and flow metrics (Work
Item Age, Cycle Time, Throughput, SLE).

The skill carries the **role** (loop, gates, heuristics, protocols — every major rule
traced to 2026 evidence in `rationale.md`). Adapters carry the **tool mechanics**
(Vikunja MCP, ClickUp MCP — both verified live). Your contract layers carry the
**instance facts** — template and layer shapes in `contracts.md`, philosophy in
[docs/contract-pattern.md](../../docs/contract-pattern.md). Instance *operations* (MCP
deployment, token rotation) stay in your instance's ops runbook.

It consolidates and supersedes the earlier `vikunja-product-owner` plugin (this repo).
**This skill is the parent-most source of the PO craft**: org estates vendor it as-is
(pinned + sync-checked) and layer their facts in
as a `product-owner-contract` sibling skill; craft improvements land here, once, for
every downstream.

## Install

**Claude Code plugin** — wires the webgrip `vikunja` MCP server for you:

```json
// .claude/settings.json
"enabledPlugins": { "product-owner@ai-skills": true }
```

The bundled `.mcp.json` points at `https://mcp-vikunja.webgrip.dev/mcp` (LAN-only); a
repo- or user-level `mcpServers` entry named `vikunja` overrides it, so give a server for
another Vikunja instance its own name. ClickUp boards: add your own
ClickUp MCP server to the consuming repo's `.mcp.json`. Scripts override via
`VIKUNJA_MCP_URL`.

**`npx skills`** — works in every agent, but registers no MCP server; add one yourself:

```bash
npx skills add https://forgejo.webgrip.dev/webgrip/ai-skills.git -s product-owner -g
```

## Board contract

The skill pins the context, then merges four contract layers (repo file → `AGENTS.md`
block → user contexts → org contract skill), most specific fact wins. The template and
what each layer's file looks like ship **inside the skill**: `contracts.md`. Facts go
in contracts; a genuinely different per-team *procedure* is a team overlay skill in the
org's estate. Without any layer, the skill inspects the connected MCP, lists
projects/boards, and asks.

## Example prompts

- "make a ticket for the flaky backup job" · "maak een ticket voor de trage pipeline"
- "what should we work on next?" · "refine the next 10 tickets" · "split this, it's too big"
- "is this ticket ready for an agent to pick up?" · "prepare these tickets for Copilot/Claude"
- "run a board-health audit" · "what's our cycle time — can we state an SLE?"
- "is dit ticket klaar voor de sprint?" · "groom the customer backlog"
- "is PR #87 mergeable?" · "the agent's PR is green, merge it" · "mag deze MR gemerged worden?"
